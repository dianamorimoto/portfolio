            Taylor Swift is an American singer-songwriter who rose to fame in 2006 with her self-titled debut country album single "Tim McGraw." 
            She has released fifteen albums, four of which are rerecordings with additional tracks that were previously cut for length. 
            She is the first artist to win the Grammy for album of the year four times. 
            Her Eras Tour broke the record for highest grossing concert tour, raking in an impressive $2 billion. 
            Numbers play an important role in Swift's life; as many Swifties (fans of Taylor Swift) know, 13 is Swift's lucky number (the date she was born) and one of her most popular albums is named "1989" after the year she was born.

        <p class="rep-description">
            Reputation (styled as "reputation") is Swift's sixth studio album. 
            Released in 2017, the album came out at the height of public scrutiny surrounding Swift's personal and romantic life. 
            Reputation is Swift's repsonse to the scrunity. 
            Her very public feud with the Kardashians and Ye (the rapper formerly known as Kanye West) had fellow celebrities taking sides. 
            The feud is a notable event in pop culture and is referenced throughout her songs.

        <h2>Folklore Era</h2>
        <p class="folklore-description">
            Released in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Folklore (styled as "folklore") is a shift towards indie-folk influences. 
            As a surprise-release, Folklore was introduced to the world with very little fanfare. 
            Nevertheless, not only was it the bestselling album of 2020, but it also won the Grammy's album of the year and was heralded by music critics as one of her best lyricism. 
            Her storytelling of both real and fictional characters is a switch from Swift's usual autobiographical songs.
